# MCMCv4
Code for simulating Random fuzzy spaces. This is the version used to generate the data for 1612.00713 and 1902.03590 which is a somewhat updated version of the code used in 1510.01377

This code relies on two external libaries. The Eigen::MatrixXcd class is implemented in the Eigen Matrix library https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/ and my code uses version 3.24 of it.

The code also requires a random number generator which I used from here class https://www.agner.org/random/
